# MAMBA

Mamba, a take on the classic game of Snake. Players help Kobe secure as many Larry O'Brien Championship Trophies as possible without getting a technical foul!

Use your keyboard arrow keys or the on screen buttons to start the game and change directions. The game will end if you run into a wall or Kobe's trophies.
