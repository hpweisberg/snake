# MAMBA

A take on the classic game of Snake. Players help NBA legend Kobe Bryant, aka, "Black Mamba"  secure as many NBA Championship Trophies as possible without getting a technical foul!

## Getting Started 🐍

Use your keyboard arrow keys or the on screen buttons to start the game and change directions. The game will end if you run into a wall or Kobe's trophies.
